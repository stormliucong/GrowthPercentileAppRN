# A React Native App for Plotting Growth Curve

## Description
This is a react native app that plots growth curve for children. The app is built using the Expo framework. The app is built with a simple user interface that allows users to input the age and weight of a child and then plots the growth curve for the child. The app is built to be user friendly and easy to use.

## How to run the app
To run the app, you need to have the Expo CLI installed on your computer. If you do not have Expo CLI installed, you can install it by running the following command:
```
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```
After installing Expo CLI, you can run the app by running the following command:
```
npx expo start
```
The above command will start the Expo development server and open the Expo developer tools in your browser. You can then run the app on an Android or iOS emulator or on your physical device using the Expo Go app.
